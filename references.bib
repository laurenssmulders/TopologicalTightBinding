	abstract = {Chitin is a natural polysaccharides having a unique molecular arrangement of 2-(acetylamino)-2-deoxy-d-glucose, it possesses multifunctional properties and is suitable for various applications mainly in pharmaceutical, biomedical food, textiles and packaging fields. Therefore, being considered as a superior material for a sustainable future of industrial development, chitin perfectly meets up the demands with diversified functionalities in applications, excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability. Non-toxicity to human and environment (air, water and soil) is a great opportunity for this revolutionary, innovative and sustainable material. Moreover, antibacterial potency and low immunogenicity of chitin have broadened the aspects of research and development on structure-function relationship toward biological tissues and activities. Despite abundance, low cost and availability, many experimental data from potential studies, reproducibility problems of chitin solubility measurement still limit the development of products and access to the market in large volume. Batch-to-batch variability, non-precise characterization and randomly distributed acetyl groups of chitin structure eventually results in a bad reproducibility of chitin solubility. Therefore, the chapter aims to organize the information of chitin structure at molecular level and correlate solubility with chitin structure. Moreover, the dissolution mechanism and solution behaviors in different solvents will be discussed in this chapter.},

For this, scaffolds with appropriate biomorphic surfaces promoting cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation are needed. In this study, eight triply-periodic minimal surface ({TPMS})-based scaffolds were designed using specific trigonometric equations, providing the same porosity and the same number of unit cells, while presenting different surface curvatures. The scaffolds were fabricated by stereolithography using a photocurable resin based on the biocompatible, biodegradable and rubber-like material, poly(trimethylene carbonate) ({PTMC}). A numerical approach was developed to calculate the surface curvature distributions of the {TPMS} architectures. Moreover, the scaffolds were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, micro-computed tomography and water permeability measurements. These original scaffold architectures will be helpful to decipher the biofunctional role of the surface curvature of scaffolds intended for tissue engineering applications.},

This fabrication procedure presents a simplified route for constructing multilayer structures where planarization is necessary, including three-dimensional photonic crystals (3DPCs) or three-dimensional metamaterials. To demonstrate the robustness of the approach, multiple 3DPCs were fabricated and optically characterized. Multiplane waveguide defects were inserted in the crystals and characterized. The vertical waveguides demonstrate enhanced transmission of light, and work continues to realize waveguiding through the full three-dimensional network of waveguides.},

First, by inverting refractive index data published for chitin-chitosan composite samples, it was possible to obtain the spectral dependence of the refractive indices of both materials. Reflection and transmission measurements of non-polarized light were carried out from samples of fresh shrimp shells. From these spectrophotometric measurements we obtained the refractive index of the composite medium chitin-uric acid as well as the corresponding extinction coefficient through the mentioned spectral wavelength range. The absorption of light by the chitin is negligible for the wavelengths considered. The extinction coefficient of uric acid shows absorption bands in the near ultraviolet. Absorbance measurements confirm the presence of uric acid in the chitin samples obtained from fresh shrimps. By way of illustrative example, the optical constants of chitin are used to model the structural color of a shield bug from Asia: the Poecilocoris lewisi.},

By the creative application of traditional distance field algorithm into the Boolean operations of the anatomical model and {TPMS}-based unit cell library, an almost defects free porous scaffolds having the complicated micro-structure and high quality external surface faithful to a specific anatomic model can be easily obtained without the difficult and time-consuming trimming and re-meshing processes. After generating the distance fields for the given tissue model and required internal micro-structure, a series of simple modifications in distance fields enable us to obtain a complex porous scaffold. Experimental results show that the proposed scaffold design method has the potential to combine the perfectly interconnected pore networks based on the {TPMS} unit cell libraries and the given external geometry in a consistent framework irrespective of the complexity of the models.},

Here, we introduce non-Abelian topological charges that characterize line nodes inside the momentum space of crystalline metals with space-time inversion (\${\textbackslash}mathcal\{{PT}\}\$) symmetry and with weak spinorbit coupling. We show that these are quaternion charges, similar to those describing disclinations in biaxial nematics. Starting from two-band considerations, we develop the complete many-band description of nodes in the presence of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{{PT}\}\$ and mirror symmetries, which allows us to investigate the topological stability of nodal chains in metals. The non-Abelian charges put strict constraints on the possible nodal-line configurations. Our analysis goes beyond the standard approach to band topology and implies the existence of one-dimensional topological phases not present in existing classifications.},

	abstract = {Topological phases of matter span a wide area of research shaping fundamental pursuits and offering promise for future applications. While a significant fraction of topological materials has been characterized using symmetry requirements of wave functions, the past two years have witnessed the rise of novel multi-gap dependent topological states, the properties of which go beyond these approaches and are yet to be fully explored. Thriving upon these insights, we report on uncharted anomalous phases and properties that can only arise in out-of-equilibrium Floquet settings. In particular, we identify Floquet-induced non-Abelian braiding mechanisms, which in turn lead to a phase characterized by an anomalous Euler class, the prime example of a multi-gap topological invariant. Most strikingly, we also retrieve the first example of an `anomalous Dirac string phase'. This gapped out-of-equilibrium phase features an unconventional Dirac string configuration that physically manifests itself via anomalous edge states on the boundary. Our results therefore not only provide a stepping stone for the exploration of intrinsically dynamical and experimentally viable multi-gap topological phases, but also demonstrate a powerful way to observe these non-Abelian processes notably in quantum simulators.},
